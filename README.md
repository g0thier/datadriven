## 🚀 Quick start

1. Use this folder as a base for your new open source project.
2. Rename the project and update this `README.md`.
3. Replace placeholder content in:
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `SECURITY.md`
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`
   - `LICENSE.md` (if needed)
4. Add your source code and project-specific docs.
5. Publish and maintain the repository using your contribution workflow.

## 🐳 Install & execute

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🥽 Security

- See [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting guidelines.

## 📸 Page screenshots

Generate screenshots automatically for all routes declared with `<Route path="...">` in `src/`:

```bash
npm run screenshots
```

The script:
- discovers routes automatically in `src/**/*.js(x)/ts(x)`
- skips dynamic routes by default (with `:`), unless `SCREENSHOT_INCLUDE_DYNAMIC=true`
- starts the Vite server automatically (`npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173`)
- saves images into `docs/images/`

If protected routes require login, set these keys in `.env.local`:

```bash
SCREENSHOT_AUTH_EMAIL=you@example.com
SCREENSHOT_AUTH_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Optional overrides:

```bash
SCREENSHOT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173
SCREENSHOT_LOGIN_PATH=/login
SCREENSHOT_EXTRA_ROUTES=/foo,/bar
SCREENSHOT_AUTO_START=false
SCREENSHOT_DEV_COMMAND="npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173"
```
